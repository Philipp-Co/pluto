# pluto_config

## Tests

Files for testing will be created under pluto_config/test/ressources/ .
Configuration Files which are used for testing are generated for each Test Case in the specific Test Case.
Filepaths and Names are given through CMake. CMake will set Compile Time Contants which in turn are used by the Test Cases to generate their Ressources.
